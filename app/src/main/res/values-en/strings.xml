    <!-- Explanation Concepts -->
    <string name="what_is_nephrotic_syndrome">What is Nephrotic Syndrome?</string>
    <string name="nephrotic_syndrome_explanation">Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney condition in which the kidneys lose large amounts of protein in the urine. This causes swelling (edema), especially in the feet, ankles, and around the eyes.</string>

    <string name="what_is_proteinuria">What is Proteinuria?</string>
    <string name="proteinuria_explanation">Proteinuria is the presence of abnormal amounts of protein in the urine. Under normal conditions, only minimal traces of protein should be present, but in nephrotic syndrome more than 3.5 grams can be lost per day.</string>

    <string name="what_is_hypoalbuminemia">What is Hypoalbuminemia?</string>
    <string name="hypoalbuminemia_explanation">Hypoalbuminemia is the low level of albumin in the blood. Albumin is a protein that helps maintain fluid within blood vessels. When it is lost in urine, fluid leaks into tissues causing swelling.</string>

    <string name="what_is_hyperlipidemia">What is Hyperlipidemia?</string>
    <string name="hyperlipidemia_explanation">Hyperlipidemia is the increase of fats (lipids) in the blood. It occurs as the liver\'s response to protein loss, producing more cholesterol and triglycerides than normal.</string>

    <string name="what_is_edema">What is Edema?</string>
    <string name="edema_explanation">Edema is swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body\'s tissues. In nephrotic syndrome, it occurs mainly in the legs, ankles, hands, and around the eyes.</string>

    <string name="what_is_postinfectious_gn">What is Post-infectious GN?</string>
    <string name="postinfectious_gn_explanation">Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is an immune-mediated kidney disease that occurs after an infection, typically streptococcal. The immune system produces antibodies that mistakenly attack the glomeruli.</string>

    <string name="what_is_glomerulus">What is the Glomerulus?</string>
    <string name="glomerulus_explanation">The glomerulus is the kidney\'s filtration unit. Each kidney has approximately one million glomeruli that function as tiny filters, removing waste and retaining essential proteins in the blood.</string>

    <string name="what_is_immune_complex">What is Immune Complex?</string>
    <string name="immune_complex_explanation">Immune complexes are combinations of antibodies and antigens that form during infections. In post-infectious GN, these complexes can deposit in the kidneys and cause inflammation.</string>

    <string name="what_is_complement_c3">What is Complement C3?</string>
    <string name="complement_c3_explanation">Complement C3 is a protein of the immune system that helps fight infections. In post-infectious GN, its levels are usually low because it is consumed during the inflammatory response.</string>

    <string name="what_is_hematuria">What is Hematuria?</string>
    <string name="hematuria_explanation">Hematuria is the presence of blood in the urine. It can be visible (red or brown urine) or microscopic. It is a common sign of inflammation in the kidneys.</string>

    <string name="what_is_hypertension">What is Hypertension?</string>
    <string name="hypertension_explanation">Hypertension is high blood pressure. In kidney diseases, it occurs because the kidneys cannot properly regulate sodium and water, increasing blood volume and pressure.</string>

    <string name="what_is_corticosteroids">What are Corticosteroids?</string>
    <string name="corticosteroids_explanation">Corticosteroids (like prednisone) are potent anti-inflammatory medications that suppress the immune system. They are used to reduce kidney inflammation and decrease protein loss.</string>

    <string name="what_is_diuretics">What are Diuretics?</string>
    <string name="diuretics_explanation">Diuretics are medications that help eliminate excess fluid and salt from the body through urine. They are used to control edema and blood pressure in kidney diseases.</string>

    <string name="what_is_dialysis">What is Dialysis?</string>
    <string name="dialysis_explanation">Dialysis is a treatment that temporarily replaces kidney function when they fail. It filters the blood to remove waste and excess fluid when the kidneys cannot do it.</string>

    <string name="what_is_kidney_biopsy">What is Kidney Biopsy?</string>
    <string name="kidney_biopsy_explanation">A kidney biopsy is a procedure where a small tissue sample is taken from the kidney to examine it under a microscope. It helps determine the exact type of kidney disease and appropriate treatment.</string>

    <string name="what_is_urinalysis">What is Urinalysis?</string>
    <string name="urinalysis_explanation">Urinalysis is a fundamental test that detects proteins, blood, and other abnormal substances. It is the first tool for diagnosing and monitoring kidney diseases.</string>

    <string name="what_is_blood_test">What are Blood Tests?</string>
    <string name="blood_test_explanation">Blood tests measure kidney function (creatinine, BUN), protein levels (albumin), and other markers. They are essential for assessing the severity and progression of kidney disease.</string>
